## Overview

Unfortunately all around the world coral reefs are dying out. Due to climate change, ocean temperatures are slowly rising causing the event of coral bleaching. While pure white bleached coral may carry a beauty of its own, bleached coral is a very bad thing. Coral bleaching occurs when ocean temputures increase. Even one or two degrees Farenhiet can cause coral bleaching. Coral can recover from bleaching, but as ocean temputures keep rising more coral is getting killed by bleaching each year. In order to better track this disastor, I built a Convelutional Nueral Network that can classify between living, bleached, and dead coral.

I have always had a deep love for the ocean, so when I got idea for this project I was energized. I really wanted to find a way that I could use Machine Learning to help heal the oceans. I ended up coming accross the organization The Great Reef Cenus. The Great Reef Census is a community driven organization that's goal is to survey the various parts of the Great Barrier Reef. The Great Barrier Reef is very large and survying it is a very large task. So they have volenteers who have participated on surveys take photos and some basic data on the area of the reef they went to. I highly recommend checking out their website (https://greatreefcensus.org) if you would like to learn more or explore some of the user subbmitted surveys. In order to get more detailed information I thought it could be useful to build a classification model
